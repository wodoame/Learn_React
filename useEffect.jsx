// `useEffect` is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components.
// Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, or any other operation that isn't related to rendering.

// The `useEffect` hook is called after the component renders. It accepts two arguments: a function containing the code you want to run, and an optional dependency array that determines when the effect should run.
// Here's a basic example:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  // useEffect runs after the component renders
  useEffect(() => {
    // The code inside this function is the side effect
    fetchData(); // Assume fetchData is a function that fetches data

    // You can return a cleanup function if needed
    return () => {
      // Code to clean up the effect (unsubscribe, clear timers, etc.)
    };
  }, []); // Dependency array; empty means the effect runs only once after the initial render

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render your component with the fetched data */}
      {data && <p>{data}</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

// In this example:
// - The `useEffect` hook is used to initiate a data fetch (`fetchData`) after the initial render.
// - The empty dependency array (`[]`) means that the effect runs only once after the initial render.
// - The fetched data is stored in the component's state (`data`), and the component renders based on that data.

// If you include dependencies in the array, the effect will run whenever any of those dependencies change.
// For example:

useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run when dependency1 or dependency2 changes
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);


// Remember that if you omit the dependency array entirely, the effect will run after every render, potentially leading to performance issues.
// Always include the minimum set of dependencies to ensure your effects run when needed.
// Additionally, the `useEffect` hook can be used for cleanup operations, like unsubscribing from subscriptions or clearing timers. The cleanup function is returned from the `useEffect` callback.
