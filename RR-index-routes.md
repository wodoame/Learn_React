In React Router, **index routes** and **layout routes** are essential for structuring your application. Let's break down what they are:

1. **Index Route:**
   - An index route is a child route without a specific path. It renders within its parent's outlet at the parent's URL, acting like a default child route.
   - For example, if you have a parent route like `/teams`, an index route would render when the URL matches `/teams` directly.
   - You can define an index route using the `index` property in your route configuration¹.

2. **Layout Route:**
   - A layout route is a parent route without a path. Its primary purpose is to group child routes inside a specific layout.
   - Layout routes help organize your application by providing a consistent structure for nested routes.
   - Typically, a layout route contains an `<Outlet />` where child routes render their content.
   - Use layout routes to create reusable layouts for different sections of your app³.

Remember that both index routes and layout routes contribute to a clean and declarative route structure in your React Router application.

### Create your index component
```javascript
  export default function Index() {
    return (
      <p id="zero-state">

        .
      </p>
    );
  }
```
### Add index component to the routes
```javascript
  // existing code
  import Index from "./routes/index";
  
  const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
      path: "/",
      element: <Root />,
      errorElement: <ErrorPage />,
      loader: rootLoader,
      action: rootAction,
      children: [
        { index: true, element: <Index /> },
        /* existing routes */
      ],
    },
  ]);

// Note the { index:true } instead of { path: "" }.
// That tells the router to match and render this route when the user is at the parent route's exact path, so there are no other child routes to render in the <Outlet>.
```
