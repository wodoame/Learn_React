// In React, inline styles can be applied to components using the `style` attribute.
// The `style` attribute accepts a JavaScript object where the keys are the style properties, and the values are the corresponding values for those properties. Here's an example:

import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const inlineStyles = {
    color: 'blue',
    fontSize: '16px',
    border: '1px solid black',
    // Add more styles as needed
  };

  return (
    <div style={inlineStyles}>
      This is a component with inline styles.
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

// In this example, the `style` attribute is assigned the `inlineStyles` object, which contains various style properties such as `color`, `fontSize`, and `border`.
// You can add or remove style properties based on your requirements.
// Note that the property names are written in camelCase (e.g., `fontSize` instead of `font-size`), which is a JavaScript convention for object keys.
// Also, the property values are strings, and you can use any valid CSS values for those properties.
// If you need to dynamically set styles based on certain conditions or state, you can compute the `inlineStyles` object within the component function before rendering.
