Adding images to a React application is a common task. Here are a few ways you can do it:

1. **Using the `import` keyword:**
   - Import the image in your component file, like this:
     ```javascript
     import React from 'react';
     import logo from './logo.png'; // Assuming 'logo.png' is in the same directory
     // ...
     return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
     ```
   - Webpack will handle moving the image to the build folder during the build process.

2. **Using the `require` keyword:**
   - Similar to the `import` approach, but using `require`:
     ```javascript
     const logo = require('./logo.png');
     // ...
     return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
     ```

3. **Importing SVGs directly as React components:**
   - If you have an SVG file, you can import it directly as a React component:
     ```javascript
     import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';
     // ...
     return <Logo />;
     ```

4. **Loading images directly from the network:**
   - You can use a remote image URL directly in the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag:
     ```javascript
     return <img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Example" />;
     ```
   - Make sure to replace the URL with the actual image URL you want to display.

Remember to adjust the paths and filenames according to your project structure.

The import name should match the **filename** of the image you want to use. For example, if your image file is named `logo.png`, you would import it like this:

```javascript
import logo from './logo.png';
```

Make sure the path is correct relative to your component file.

If your image file name contains spaces or hyphens, you can still import it in React. However, you'll need to follow these rules:

1. **Spaces in File Names:**
   - Replace spaces with underscores or camelCase.
   - For example, if your file is named `my image.png`, you can import it like this:
     ```javascript
     import myImage from './my_image.png';
     ```

2. **Hyphens in File Names:**
   - Keep the hyphens as they are.
   - For example, if your file is named `cool-image.jpg`, import it like this:
     ```javascript
     import coolImage from './cool-image.jpg';
     ```

Remember to adjust the import name to match your filename, and ensure the path is correct.
