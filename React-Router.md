React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps UI in sync with the URL.

Key features include:
- **Dynamic Routing**: Defined as needed, not at the start of the app.
- **Hooks**: Use `useParams`, `useLocation`, `useHistory`, and `useRouteMatch` hooks for building component-centric routes.
- **Nested Routes**: Organize the UI into a nested hierarchy of components.

React Router v6 introduced some changes like relative routing and links, route ranking, and automatic route ranking.
