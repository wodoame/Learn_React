`createBrowserRouter` is a function in React Router v6 used to create a new router instance. It's part of the new features introduced in version 6 that simplifies the process of creating and configuring the router.

Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```javascript
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

// Define your routes
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <Home />,
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    element: <About />,
  },
  // ... other routes
]);

// Render the router
function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  );
}

export default App;
```

This function takes an array of route objects and returns a router instance that you pass to `RouterProvider`. Each route object has a `path` and an `element` property, where `element` is the component to render when the route's path matches the URL.
